# Model-Predictions-----Feature-Engineering

## Creating a model to predict whether Steph Curry will make a shot based on his past performance.

For this project, I will use a dataset with all Steph Curry's NBA fild goal attempts from October 2009 through June 2019 (regualr season and Playoffs).  The dataset was colleded with the nba_api Python library.
